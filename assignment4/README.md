# Assignment 4

## How to run:
Seeing as a lot of these tasks are connected, it makes the most sense to examine the results by running time_planner.py and fetch_player_statistics.py for tasks 1 through 10

As for wiki_race_challenge.py, it too can be run from the command line.

Here's an example run:

```
python wiki_race_challenge.py
