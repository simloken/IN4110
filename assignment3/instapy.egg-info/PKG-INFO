# instapy

This python module lets you apply grayscale or sepia filters to a picture. You can then either view these changes directly or save it locally as a file

Additionally, there are four seperate methods to do this, a pure python implementation, a numpy implementation, a numba implementation and a cython implementation

To install the module, simply extract the contents of "assignment 3" as-is, then make that your working directory, before inputting

```
python -m pip install . --user
```

Generally, the module can be run from the command line as:

```
python -m instapy [file] [-o OUTPUTNAME] [-i IMPLEMENTATIONNAME] [-f FILTERNAME] [-sc SCALE] [-r BOOL]
```

Further help and/or explanation can be found by

```
python -m instapy -h
```

Here is an example run:

```
...\assignment3>python -m instapy test/rain.jpg -o Output -i numpy -f color2sepia -sc 2 -r False
```
